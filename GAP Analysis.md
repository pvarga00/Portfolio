Follow this easy process for achieving your goals/wants/desires!

Questions to ask yourself:
What do I WANT? (For my career, self, relationships, life)

Clearly define the things you want - and then set reasonable, actionable goals with a "due date" to be achieved by.

 

Fill out the below fields:

GAP Analysis:
Do I have the skills/knowledge/things to help me achieve my goals currently?

What skills/knowledge do I want/need to support my goals?

Current State:

This is a listing of all of the things that you currently have


Future State to achieve (knowledge, skills, behavior):

This is a listing of all of the things you want to have/achieve




Opportunities : How Do I Get There:

These are the "gaps" between what you have now and what you want to have/achieve
These are things you'll need to focus on, create a plan for, and determine how to get the information you need in order to transform into your desired state
 

Plan for "Getting the Stuff I need to have"
Roadmap / Plan:
How will I acquire the skills/knowledge/things that I'm missing?

Who can help me gain the things I need?

How will I know if I have achieved "enough" to be successful? Can I measure my progress? (Remember to celebrate any achieved supporting goals!)

How can I stay motivated?

Develop and agree on an action plan and follow up strategies:

What specific actions will help you achieve your goal?

What will your first steps be? When will you start?

Who can help hold you accountable?

How will you keep focused on your goals and plans?

Enlist support from others:

Who can support you in moving forward?

How can I support you? (Here is how I see my role...)

When should we touch base to review our plans (reoccurring)

SMART Goals:
S - specific, significant, stretching

M - measurable, meaningful, motivational

A - agreed upon, attainable, achievable, acceptable, action-oriented

R - realistic, relevant, reasonable, rewarding, results-oriented

T - time-based, time-bound, timely, tangible, trackable

 

Timelines:
Activities to accomplish, that builds towards achieving your SMART goals:

Daily
Weekly
Monthly
Yearly
 

Note: Keep daily/weekly activities "small, and fast/easily accomplished" so that they accumulate to larger Monthly goals that drive the overall progress forward. Not getting discouraged by not getting them done - but building momentum... 

 

Goals: 
Set 1 daily goal - all goals should be SMART

Set 1 weekly goal - make sure that your daily goals are in support of the weekly goal

Set 1 monthly goal - make sure that your weekly goals are in support of the monthly goal

Set 1 yearly goal - make sure that your monthly goals are in support of the yearly goal

Set 1 5-year goal - make sure that your yearly goals are in support of the 5-year goal

**Note: Make sure that you are continually evaluating your actions, goals, and WANTS -- to make sure that you're still doing things that support what you want to achieve -- and that you still want to commit to the work to achieve those wants.
